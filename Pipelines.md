# Data Pipelines

For our social pair task, we want to build a data pipeline rather than the usual ad-hoc data storage. 

Here are some links. The idea is to use either Datajoint or Alyx and follow the NWB specs as much as possible:

* Datajoint: https://datajoint.com/docs/core/
* Alyx: https://alyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
* Simpler alternative: Expipe - https://github.com/CINPLA/expipe
* [DataJoint for MATLAB](https://github.com/datajoint/datajoint-matlab)
* [NWB Core Principles Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346669999_Core_principles_for_the_implementation_of_the_neurodata_without_borders_data_standard)
